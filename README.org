* graphene_adsorption_paper
Paper regarding adsorption of amino acids onto graphene.

Structured in branches for each section (i.e. introduction,
methods...). Commits every paragraph and when stopping for the day.

** Structure

- data: data used for figures, scripts and tables may reference these files
  + 5ala: PMF(\xi) of peptides
  + glutamic: analysis of gluamate intramolecular interactions
  + pmfs: PMF(\xi) for all amino acids over graphene
  + tables: .csv files for different energetic components
  + unbias: unbiased energies
- figures: For all figures
- *gromos:* Input files for GROMOS (1.4.0)
- paper: .tex files for the article
- scripts: any relevant script for the creation of figures (there is
  also a "copy files" script but it is only expected to work on my computer)
