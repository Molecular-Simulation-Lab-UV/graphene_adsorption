* graphene_adsorption_paper
Paper regarding adsorption of amino acids onto graphene.

Structured in branches for each section (i.e. introduction,
methods...). Commits every paragraph and when stopping for the day.

** Structure

- data: data used for figures, scripts and tables may reference these files
  + pmfs: PMF(\xi) for all amino acids over graphene
  + tables: .csv files for
    * Free energy decomposition (\Delta A, \Delta E, T\Delta S)
    * Energy decomposition (into VdW and CRF)
    * Entropy (schlitter/quasi-harmonic) and Diffusion coefficientes
    * SASA
- figures: For all figures
- paper: .tex files for the paper
  + main.tex: LaTeX file
  + refs.bib: Reference file
- scripts: any relevant script for the creation of figures (there is
  also a "copy files" script but it is only expected to work on my computer)
- tables: any tables as separate .tex files to remove clutter
  in main.tex
