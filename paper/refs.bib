abstract = {Abstract Graphene, a unique two-dimensional single-atom-thin nanomaterial with exceptional structural, mechanical, and electronic properties, has spurred an enormous interest in many fields, including biomedical applications, which at the same time ignites a growing concern on its biosafety and potential cytotoxicity to human and animal cells. In this review, we present a summary of some very recent studies on this important subject with both experimental and theoretical approaches. The molecular interactions of graphene with proteins, DNAs, and cell membranes (both bacteria and mammalian cells) are discussed in detail. Severe distortions in structures and functions of these biomacromolecules by graphene are identified and characterized. For example, the graphene is shown to disrupt bacteria cell membranes by insertion/cutting as well as destructive extraction of lipid molecules directly. More interestingly, this cytotoxicity has been shown to have implications in de novo design of nanomedicine, such as graphene-based band-aid, a potential ‘green’ antibiotics due to its strong physical-based (instead of chemical-based) antibacterial capability. These studies have provided a better understanding of graphene nanotoxicity at both cellular and molecular levels, and also suggested therapeutic potential by using graphene's cytotoxicity against bacteria cells.

The amino acid–graphene interactions are favorable irrespective of the force field. While the magnitudes of ΔAads differ between the force fields{,} the relative free energy of adsorption across amino acids is similar for the studied force fields. ΔAads positively correlates with amino acid–graphene and negatively correlates with graphene–water interaction energies. Using a combination of principal component analysis and density-based clustering technique{,} we grouped the structures observed in the graphene adsorbed state. The resulting population of clusters{,} and the conformation in each cluster indicate that the structures of the amino acid in the graphene adsorbed state vary across force fields. The differences in the conformations of amino acids are more severe in the graphene adsorbed state compared to the bulk state for all the force fields. Our findings suggest that the force fields studied will give qualitatively consistent relative strength of adsorption across proteins but different structural preferences in the graphene adsorbed state."}

abstract  ="Peptide binding to a graphene sheet is studied by a coarse-grained approach. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is used to assess the adsorption energy (e.g. binding) of each amino acid with graphene. The relative adsorption energy of each residue is normalized to describe its coarse-grained interactions with graphene which is used as an input to a phenomenological interaction in an all-residue coarse-grained (ARCG) representation of the peptide chain. Large scale Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are performed to study the stability of peptides (P1: 1H–2S–3S–4Y–5W–6Y–7A–8F–9N–10N–11K–12T and P2: 1E–2P–3L–4Q–5L–6K–7M) binding to a graphene sheet as a function of temperature. A number of local and global physical quantities are analyzed including mobility and substrate-in-contact profiles of each residue{,} density profiles, root mean square displacement of the center of mass of each peptide and its radius of gyration. We find that P1 has a higher probability of binding to a graphene sheet than P2 supported by both local and global physical quantities. All residues of P1 can bind to the graphene sheet at low temperatures; however, three residues 4Y–5W–6Y seem to anchor it most strongly at higher temperatures, which is consistent with an all-atom MD simulation."

  abstract = {"We explored an intelligent vaccine system via facile approaches using both experimental and theoretical techniques based on the two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO). Without extra addition of bio/chemical stimulators, the microsized GO imparted various immune activation tactics to improve the antigen immunogenicity. A high antigen adsorption was acquired, and the mechanism was revealed to be a combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and $\pi--\pi$ stacking interactions. The “folding GO” acted as a cytokine self-producer and antigen reservoir and showed a particular autophagy, which efficiently promoted the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and subsequent antigen cross-presentation. Such a “One but All” modality thus induced a high level of anti-tumor responses in a programmable way and resulted in efficient tumor regression in vivo. This work may shed light on the potential use of a new dimensional nano-platform in the development of high-performance cancer vaccines.}

A WCA value of 45° ± 3° was measured for a clean HOPG surface, which can serve as the intrinsic WCA for multilayer graphene. A 1 min plasma treatment (100 W) decreased the WCA to 6°, owing to the creation of surface defects and functionalization by oxygen-containing groups. Molecular dynamics simulations of water droplets on the HOPG surface with or without the oxygen-containing defect sites confirmed the experimental results. Heat treatment at near atmospheric pressure and wet chemical cleaning methods using hydrofluoric acid and chloroform did not change the WCA significantly.

abstract = {The widespread use of nanomaterials in biomedical applications has been accompanied by an increasing interest in understanding their interactions with tissues, cells, and biomolecules, and in particular, on how they might affect the integrity of cell membranes and proteins. In this mini-review, we present a summary of some of the recent studies on this important subject, especially from the point of view of large scale molecular simulations. The carbon-based nanomaterials and noble metal nanoparticles are the main focus, with additional discussions on quantum dots and other nanoparticles as well. The driving forces for adsorption of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanosheets onto proteins or cell membranes are found to be mainly hydrophobic interactions and the so-called $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking (between aromatic rings), while for the noble metal nanoparticles the long-range electrostatic interactions play a bigger role. More interestingly, there are also growing evidences showing that nanotoxicity can have implications in de novo design of nanomedicine. For example, the endohedral metallofullerenol Gd@C82(OH)22 is shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting enzyme MMP-9, and graphene is illustrated to disrupt bacteria cell membranes by insertion/cutting as well as destructive extraction of lipid molecules. These recent findings have provided a better understanding of nanotoxicity at the molecular level and also suggested therapeutic potential by using the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles against cancer or bacteria cells.

Interestingly, all carbon atoms in these defective areas are bonded to three neighbors maintaining a planar sp(2)-configuration, which makes them undetectable by spectroscopic techniques.

We develop functionalization chemistry in order to impart solubility and compatibility of NGO in biological environments. We obtain size separated pegylated NGO sheets that are soluble in buffers and serum without agglomeration. The NGO sheets are found to be photoluminescent in the visible and infrared regions. The intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) of NGO is used for live cell imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) with little background. We found that simple physisorption via pi-stacking can be used for loading doxorubicin, a widely used cancer drug onto NGO functionalized with antibody for selective killing of cancer cells in vitro. Owing to its small size, intrinsic optical properties, large specific surface area, low cost, and useful non-covalent interactions with aromatic drug molecules, NGO is a promising new material for biological and medical applications.},

The present study investigated the antibacterial efficiency of graphene nanosheets against four types of pathogenic bacteria. Graphene nanosheets are synthesized by a hydrothermal approach (under alkaline conditions using hydrazine hydrate). UV−vis and X-ray diffraction show a maximum absorbance at 267 nm and appearance of new broad diffraction peak at 26°, which ensures the reduction of graphene oxide into graphene nanosheets. Stretching and bending vibrations of C−C bonds, chemical states, disorder, and defects associated with the graphene nanosheets are evaluated in comparison with graphene oxide. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of graphene nanosheets against pathogenic bacteria was evaluated by a microdilution method. MICs such as 1 $\mu$g/mL (against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium), 8 $\mu$g/mL (against Enterococcus faecalis), and 4 $\mu$g/mL (against Bacillus subtilis) suggest that graphene nanosheets have predominant antibacterial activity compared to the standard antibiotic, kanamycin. Measurement of free radical modulation activity of graphene nanosheets suggested the involvement of reactive oxygen species in antibacterial properties.},

abstract  ="Investigation of the non-covalent interaction of biomolecules with aqueous graphene interfaces is a rapidly expanding area. However{,} reliable exploitation of these interfaces in many applications requires that the links between the sequence and binding of the adsorbed peptide structures be clearly established. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can play a key role in elucidating the conformational ensemble of peptides adsorbed at graphene interfaces{,} helping to elucidate these rules in partnership with experimental characterisation. We apply our recently-developed polarisable force-field for biomolecule–graphene interfaces{,} GRAPPA{,} in partnership with advanced simulation approaches{,} to probe the adsorption behaviour of peptides at aqueous graphene. First we determine the free energy of adsorption of all twenty naturally occurring amino acids (AAs) via metadynamics simulations{,} providing a benchmark for interpreting peptide–graphene adsorption studies. From these free energies{,} we find that strong-binding amino acids have flat and/or compact side chain groups{,} and we relate this behaviour to the interfacial solvent structuring. Second{,} we apply replica exchange with solute tempering simulations to efficiently and widely sample the conformational ensemble of two experimentally-characterised peptide sequences{,} P1 and its alanine mutant P1A3{,} in solution and adsorbed on graphene. For P1 we find a significant minority of the conformational ensemble possesses a helical structure{,} both in solution and when adsorbed{,} while P1A3 features mostly extended{,} random-coil conformations. In solution this helical P1 configuration is stabilised through favourable intra-peptide interactions{,} while the adsorbed structure is stabilised via interaction of four strongly-binding residues{,} identified from our metadynamics simulations{,} with the aqueous graphene interface.

  Abstract                 = {It is generally accepted that the hydrophilic property of graphene can be affected by the underlying substrate. However, the role of intrinsic vs substrate contributions and the related mechanisms are vividly debated. Here, we show that the intrinsic hydrophilicity of graphene can be intimately connected to the position of its Fermi level, which affects the interaction between graphene and water molecules. The underlying substrate, or dopants, can tune hydrophilicity by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. By shifting the Fermi level of graphene away from its Dirac point, via either chemical or electrical voltage doping, we show enhanced hydrophilicity with experiments and first principle simulations. Increased vapor condensation on graphene, induced by a simple shifting of its Fermi level, exemplifies applications in the area of interfacial transport phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of including the polarizability of both water and graphene in molecular dynamics simulations of the water/graphene system was quantified. A thin film of either rigid single point charge extended (SPC/E) water or polarizable simple 4-site water model with Drude polarizability (SWM4{\_}DP) water on non-polarizable and polarizable graphene surfaces was simulated. The graphene surface was either maintained neutral or charged, positively and negatively. The results suggest that SPC∕E and SWM4{\_}DP water models yield very similar predictions for the water structural properties on neutral non-polarizable graphene, although they yield slightly different dynamical properties of interfacial water on neutral non-polarizable graphene. More pronounced were the differences obtained when graphene was modeled with a polarizable force field. In particular, the polarizability of graphene was found to enhance the number of interfacial SWM4{\_}DP water molecules pointing one of their OH bonds towards the neutral surface. Despite this structural difference, the dynamical properties predicted for the interfacial SWM4{\_}DP water were found to be independent on polarizability as long as the polarizability of a carbon atom is smaller than $\alpha$ = 0.878 A. On charged graphene surfaces, the effect of polarizability of graphene on structural properties and some dynamical properties of SWM4{\_}DP water is negligible because electrostatic forces due to surface charge dominate polarization forces, as expected. For all cases, our results suggest that the hydrogen bond network is insensitive to the polarizability of both water and graphene. Understanding how these effects will determine the accumulation of ions near neutral or charged graphene could have important implications for applications in the fields of energy storage and water desalination.},

Hydrocarbon contamination, known to be the source for the usually observed hydrophobic property of graphite, also affects protein adsorption processes as shown in this study. In the computational part of this work ethane was used as a model hydrocarbon which acts on the surface by reducing the water-surface and protein-surface interactions. This contamination then results in higher water contact angles. The process of protein adsorption is studied for the example of insulin revealing a reduction in adsorption strength despite the surface being more hydrophobic when contaminated. Although the proteins did not denature on the contaminated surfaces, further processes -- such as the displacement of hydrocarbons by the protein -- may occur on a longer time scale. In conclusion we argue that proteins adsorb faster on pure than on contaminated surfaces with respect to the molecular dynamics time scale of ns.},

  Abstract                 = {Although experimental and theoretical studies have addressed the question of the wetting properties of graphene, the actual value of the contact angle of water on an isolated graphene monolayer remains unknown. While recent experimental literature indicates that the contact angle of water on graphite is in the range 90-95°, it has been suggested that the contact angle on graphene may either be as high as 127° or moderately enhanced in comparison with graphite. With the support of classical molecular dynamics simulations using empirical force-fields, we develop an argumentation to show that the value of 127° is an unrealistic estimate and that a value of the order of 95-100° should be expected. Our study establishes a connection between the variation of the work of adhesion of water on graphene-based surfaces and the interaction potential between individual water molecules and these surfaces. We show that a variation of the contact angle from 90° on graphite to 127° on graphene would imply that both of the first two carbon layers of graphite contribute approximately the same interaction energy with water. Such a situation is incompatible with the short-range nature of the interaction between water and this substrate. We also show that the interaction potential energy between water and the graphene-based substrates is the main contribution to the work of adhesion of water with a relative magnitude that is independent of the number of graphene layers. We introduce the idea that the remaining contribution is entropic in nature and is connected to the fluctuations in the water-substrate interaction energy.},

@article{Kamel2020,
abstract = {Graphene–amino acid interaction is gaining significance mainly based on its possible biomedicine applications. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) are applied to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the adsorption mechanism of three kinds of amino acids, namely, alanine (Ala), glycine (Gly), and valine (Val) over the surface of graphene and functionalized graphene nanosheets. In this study, several analyses such as solvation energy, adsorption energy, intermolecular distances, and charge properties are used to explore the adsorption behavior of amino acid on the nanosheets. The calculated adsorption energies show that the interaction of amino acids with functionalized graphene is greater than the pristine graphene. Regarding DFT computations, the adsorption of Val on the graphene about − 10 kJ/mol is stronger than Gly and Ala. Meanwhile, it is found that the geometrical parameters and electronic properties of graphene change drastically upon functionalization, and the formation of hydrogen bonds between –COOH functional group and amino acids enhances the adsorption energy about 12–30{\%}. To obtain a deeper comprehension of the interaction nature, the atoms in molecules (AIM) and the natural bond orbital (NBO) studies have been performed. Furthermore, the MD simulations are employed to assess the dynamic properties of our designed systems. The results from the present study demonstrate that the movement of the amino acids into the carriers is spontaneous and forms stable complexes.},

@article{Welch2015,
abstract = {The characteristic properties of graphene make it useful in an assortment of applications. One particular application - the use of graphene in biosensors - requires a thorough understanding of graphene-peptide interactions. In this study, the binding of glycine (G) capped amino acid residues (termed GXG tripeptides) to trilayer graphene surfaces in aqueous solution was examined and compared to results previously obtained for peptide binding to single-layer free-standing graphene [A. N. Camden, S. A. Barr, and R. J. Berry, J. Phys. Chem. B 117, 10691-10697 (2013)]. In order to understand the interactions between the peptides and the surface, binding enthalpy and free energy values were calculated for each GXG system, where X cycled through the typical 20 amino acids. When the GXG tripeptides were bound to the surface, distinct conformations were observed, each with a different binding enthalpy. Analysis of the binding energy showed the binding of peptides to trilayer graphene was dominated by van der Waals interactions, unlike the free-standing graphene systems, where the binding was predominantly electrostatic in nature. These results demonstrate the utility of computational materials science in the mechanistic explanation of surface-biomolecule interactions which could be applied to a wide range of systems.},

abstract={Square millimeters of free-standing graphene do not exist per se because of thermal fluctuations in two-dimensional crystals and their tendency to collapse during the detachment from the substrate. Here we form millimeter-scale freely suspended graphene by injecting an air bubble underneath a graphene monolayer floating at the water--air interface, which allowed us to measure the contact angle on fully free-standing non-contaminated graphene. A captive bubble measurement shows that free-standing clean graphene is hydrophilic with a contact angle of 42° ± 3°. The proposed design provides a simple tool to probe and explore the wettability of two-dimensional materials in free-standing geometries and will expand our perception of two-dimensional materials technologies from microscopic to now millimeter scales.},

@article{Garate2019,
abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2019 American Chemical Society.  The projection of molecular processes onto a small set of relevant descriptors, the so-called reaction coordinates or collective variables (CVs), is a technique nowadays routinely employed by the biomolecular simulation community. In this work, we implemented two CVs to manipulate the orientation (i.e., angle) ($\mu$ - a ) and magnitude (|$\mu$ - |) of the electric dipole moment. In doing so, we studied the thermodynamics of water orientation under the application of external voltages and the folding of two polypeptides at zero-field conditions. The projection of the free-energy [potential of mean force (PMF)] along water orientation defined an upper limit of around 0.3 V for irrelevant thermodynamic effects. On the other hand, sufficiently strong $\mu$ - a restraints applied on 12-alanine (Ala 12 ) triggered structural effects because of the alignment of local dipoles; for lower restraints, a full-body rotation is achieved. The manipulation of |$\mu$ - | produced strong perturbations on the secondary structure of Ala 12 , promoting an enhanced sampling to its configurational space. Rigorous free-energy calculations in the form of 2-D PMFs for deca-alanine showed the utility of |$\mu$ - | as a reaction coordinate to study folding in small $\alpha$ helices. As a whole, we propose that the manipulation of both components of the dipole moment, $\mu$ - a and |$\mu$ - |, provides thermodynamics insights into the structural conformation and stability of biomolecules. These new CVs are implemented in the Colvars module, available for NAMD and LAMMPS.},

@article{Ryde2014,
abstract = {In this paper, enthalpy-entropy compensation (EEC) during the association of two molecules is studied by minimising model systems with molecular mechanics (MM) or quantum mechanics (QM), calculating translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions to the enthalpy and entropy with standard statistical-mechanics methods, using the rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator approach. We start with simple two-atom models, for which dispersion and electrostatics can be studied separately, showing that there is no fundamental difference between dispersion, electrostatics, or even covalent interactions. All three types of interactions give rise to EEC and a saturation of T$\Delta$S as $\Delta$H becomes strongly negative. Next, homologous series of complexes dominated either by dispersion or hydrogen bonds are studied. We see no qualitative difference between results obtained at the MM or QM level, and for all complexes except two very weak, EEC is observed, owing to the loss of translational and rotational entropy, typically counteracted by the vibrational entropy. Within homologous series, linear relations between T$\Delta$S and $\Delta$H with slopes of 0.1-1.7 are obtained with no clear difference between dispersive or hydrogen-bonded systems (but ∼0.01 for ionic and covalent interactions). These relations often reflect the increasing size of the complexes coming from the translational and rotational entropies, but at least for the hydrogen-bonded complexes, it is significantly enhanced also by the vibrational entropy (which depends on the strength of the interaction). Thus, for homologous series of molecules with repeated interactions studied in vacuum, EEC is a rule. However, if water molecules are added, the relation is blurred and it can be predicted that for a real binding reaction in water solution, both enthalpy-entropy compensation and anti-compensation can be observed, depending on the detailed interaction of the two molecules with water before and after binding, further complicated by dynamic effects. {\textcopyright} 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

Good enthalpy-entropy compensation takes place when the substrates are hydrophobic, whereas poor or no enthalpy-entropy compensation occurs when the substrates are relatively hydrophilic. A thermodynamic theory is proposed to explain the behaviors, and it is suggested that solvent molecular reorganization constitutes the physical origin of the enthalpy-entropy compensation in cyclodextrin complexation.},

abstract = {A chiral self-assembled M4L6 host assembly has been shown to be a suitable host for the supramolecular encapsulation of a series of guests in polar solvents, ranging from simple organic ammonium cations to more complex organometallic species. This molecular recognition process creates highly selective reactivity within the host cavity. In order to understand the factors driving the molecular recognition process, the standard thermodynamic parameters for encapsulation were determined for a series of protiated and fluorinated iridium guests in a variety of polar solvents using van't Hoff analysis. The encapsulation process for these guests exhibited enthalpy-entropy compensation effects. In solvents such as water and methanol, error analysis suggests a chemical origin for this behavior. In contrast, error analysis of this compensation behavior in polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide reveals that this correlation is due to an artifact inherent in the intrinsic correlation between the enthalpy and entropy terms in the van't Hoff analysis. Guest encapsulation in polar protic solvents such as water appears to be driven by initial desolvation of the guest with concomitant rearrangement of the hydrogen bond networks in solution. This behavior shares common characteristics with other synthetic and natural host-guest and molecular recognition processes in aqueous solution, ranging from simple crown ether to complex enzyme-ligand interactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Fox2018,
abstract = {Biomolecular recognition can be stubborn; changes in the structures of associating molecules, or the environments in which they associate, often yield compensating changes in enthalpies and entropies of binding and no net change in affinities. This phenomenon—termed enthalpy/entropy (H/S) compensation—hinders efforts in biomolecular design, and its incidence—often a surprise to experimentalists—makes interactions between biomolecules difficult to predict. Although characterizing H/S compensation requires experimental care, it is unquestionably a real phenomenon that has, from an engineering perspective, useful physical origins. Studying H/S compensation can help illuminate the still-murky roles of water and dynamics in biomolecular recognition and self-assembly. This review summarizes known sources of H/ S compensation (real and perceived) and lays out a conceptual framework for understanding and dissecting—and, perhaps, avoiding or exploiting—this phenomenon in biophysical systems.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of standard binding free energies describing protein:ligand association remains a daunting computational endeavor. This challenge is rooted to a large extent in the considerable changes in conformational, translational and rotational entropies underlying the binding process that atomistic simulations cannot easily capture. In spite of significant methodological advances, reflected in a continuously improving agreement with experiment, a characterization of alternate strategies aimed at measuring binding affinities, notably their respective advantages and drawbacks, is somewhat lacking. Here, two distinct avenues to determine the standard binding free energy are compared in the case of a short, proline-rich peptide associating to the Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinase Abl. These avenues - one relying upon alchemical transformations and the other on potentials of mean force (PMFs) - invoke a series of geometrical restraints acting on collective variables designed to alleviate sampling limitations inherent to classical molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental binding free energy of {\$}\Delta{\$}G bind = -7.99 kcal/mol is well reproduced by the two strategies developed herein, with {\$}\Delta{\$}G bind = -7.7 for the alchemical route and {\$}\Delta{\$}G bind = -7.8 kcal/mol for the alternate PMF-based route. In detailing the underpinnings of these numerical strategies devised for the accurate determination of standard binding free energies, many practical elements of the proposed rigorous, conceptual framework are clarified, thereby paving way to tackle virtually any recognition and association phenomenon.},

@article{Chodera2013,
abstract = {Recent calorimetric studies of interactions between small molecules and biomolecular targets have generated renewed interest in the phenomenon of entropy-enthalpy compensation. In these studies, entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding are observed to vary substantially and in an opposing manner as the ligand or protein is modified, whereas the binding free energy varies little. In severe examples, engineered enthalpic gains can lead to completely compensating entropic penalties, frustrating ligand design. Here, we examine the evidence for compensation, as well as its potential origins, prevalence, severity, and ramifications for ligand engineering. We find the evidence for severe compensation to be weak in light of the large magnitude of and correlation between errors in experimental measurements of entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding, though a limited form of compensation may be common. Given the difficulty of predicting or measuring entropic and enthalpic changes to useful precision, or using this information in design, we recommend ligand engineering efforts instead focus on computational and experimental methodologies to directly assess changes in binding free energy.},
